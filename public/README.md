## General info
The objective of tetris game is to manipulate shapes (tetrominos), by moving each one sideways and/or rotating by quarter-turns, so that they form a horizontal line without gaps. When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space and the player scores points.


You can use the buttons to manipulate tetromino or control it on the keyboard:

* Left/right arrows to move the piece laterally
* Space bar to make it pivot
* Down arrow to accelerate it
